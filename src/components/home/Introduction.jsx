            I am an undergraduate student at manipal institute of technology.
             I like making software products, participating in hackathons, 
             and thinking out various strategies to scale any product.
            Iâ€™m a big fitness enthusiast, hyper-competitive for anything
             possible, and a reader. my goals include pursuing 
             entrepreneurship, learning anything i want faster than 
             most people, being able to do muscle-ups, 
            and being able to talk to women without creeping them out.
